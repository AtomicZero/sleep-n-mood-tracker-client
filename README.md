## Description 
Project 3 was to create MERN Stack app with connected MONGDB database with routing to REACT pages using the mongoose process via Express. For this project I decided to build an sleep & mood tracker tool show these working elements.

## User Story
* I want to be able to log all the events that I have slept as a log entry within a 7-day plan and track my moods after each log entry.
* I want to be able to add new sleep/mood log entries by total hours within a designated 7-day plan.
* I want to be able to edit and resave those sleep/mood log entries.
* I also want to be able to delete those sleep/mood log entries within my plan.
* I want to be able to view a graphical overview of thosesleep/log entries on my dashboad when I sign in.
* I want to be able to add a new 7-day plan with a goal of how much sleep I'd like to achieve within those 7-days
* I want my logs to be stored in a database that I can access.
